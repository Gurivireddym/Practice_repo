The history of technology is the story of humanity's efforts to control its environment for its own benefit by creating tools.

tech 1-- technology is not only way of using machines it is also manipulating ideas to invent new things.
In 18th century generating fire with stones is also a technology method because they don't know what is exactly about technology. Actuelly we also don't know about what is exactly does the techonology because in future, people also  give better explanation about that when they are comparing with their explanation with our explanation they will feel silly like how we feel about generating fire with stones is a technology.

for example==>
		In 1822 babbage invented computer for the purpose of calculating mathamatical operations.
But now we are using computer for all type of works like data sharing , money transferring etc..
it's all done by our invention of thoughts to do some works without any strain . 

Now a days AI leads the technology, it is ivented in 1956 but no one used much in those days.It can reduce labor but it doesn't take any action by their own if any problem occurs it can not handle without human instructions.

technology is a term which is not all machines have which is a term which you present your ideas in your own way with different inventions.
